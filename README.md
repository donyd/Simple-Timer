**Author**: Donal D'silva 

_This is a first assignment project for the EDX course [Asychronous Programming with Javascript](https://www.edx.org/course/asynchronous-programming-javascript-microsoft-dev234x-0)_

These are the requirements:
* A section with a timer that displays the current elapsed time to the hundredth second
* A button labeled "Start/Stop" (starts and stops the timer as well as by pressing the 's' key)
* A button labeled "Reset" (resets the timer count and recorded times as well as pressing the 'r' key)
* A button labeled "Record Time" (records the current time and adds to the Past Times section as well as 't')
* A section labeled "Past Times" that keeps a record of previously recorded times
